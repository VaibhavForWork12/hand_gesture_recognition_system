# Hand Gesture Recognition System

A **real-time** hand gesture recognition system built with **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **TensorFlow**. This **innovative** project captures video from a webcam, detects hand landmarks with precision, and predicts gestures using a pre-trained model, displaying results directly on the video feed for an **interactive** user experience.

## About

This project showcases a **cutting-edge** solution for human-computer interaction (HCI) by enabling real-time hand gesture recognition. Leveraging the power of **MediaPipe** for hand landmark detection, **OpenCV** for video processing, and **TensorFlow** for gesture classification, it provides a seamless way to interpret hand movements. Ideal for applications like sign language interpretation, gesture-controlled interfaces, or interactive gaming, this system is designed to be **scalable** and **customizable**.

### Key Features
- **Real-Time Processing**: Detects and classifies hand gestures instantly from webcam input.
- **Accurate Landmark Detection**: Utilizes MediaPipe to identify hand landmarks with high precision.
- **Pre-Trained Model**: Employs a TensorFlow model for efficient gesture prediction.
- **Interactive Display**: Overlays predicted gestures on the live video feed for immediate feedback.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.7+**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **OpenCV**: For video capture and processing.
- **MediaPipe**: For hand landmark detection.
- **TensorFlow**: For loading and running the pre-trained gesture recognition model.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Webcam**: A functional webcam is required for input.
